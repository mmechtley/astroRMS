Python implementation of Mark Dickinson's iraf tasks for calculating
pixel-to-pixel RMS noise in astronomical images, taking into account
autocorrelation, noise variations in the weight map, and masking out
the objects themselves.

These functions are not intended to have exact parameter parity with the
MEDRMS iraf package. Rather, they are intended to provide similar
functionality with a Pythonic interface

Example usage:
import pyfits
import astroRMS
from numpy import sqrt

sciData = pyfits.getdata('myimage_drz_sci.fits')
weightData = pyfits.getdata('myimage_drz_weight.fits')
calcSection = (slice(400,600), slice(200,400))
rmsInfo = astroRMS.calc_RMS(sciData[calcSection], weightData[calcSection])

rmsData = 1/sqrt(rmsInfo['weightScale'] * weightData)
pyfits.writeto('myimage_drz_rms.fits', rmsData)
